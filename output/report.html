            <h2>Summary of the Situation</h2>
            <p>
                Severe multisystem symptoms since December 2022. A pinched nerve and a 100% gluten-free diet resolved the symptoms for a few months.
But the symptoms gradually returned.
<br /><br />
New discovery: symptoms intensify each time returning home after an absence (suspected mold).

            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>(6 months)December 2022 - June 2023:</strong> Onset of severe neurological symptoms, coinciding with water damage</li>
                <li class="subtitle">Escalation of symptoms until their peak severity. Multiple medical consultations and tests (Blood tests, EMG, MRI) without conclusive results.</li>
                
                <li><strong>(8 months) June 2023 - February 2024:</strong> Nutritionist.</li>
                <li class="subtitle">Elimination diet with significant reduction in symptoms (~50%). Diet plays a big role. Probably inflammatory.</li>
                
                <li><strong>&emsp;[July 2023]:</strong> Osteopathic treatment for a pinched nerve (recommended by a neurologist)</li>
                <li class="subtitle">Resolves some symptoms and reduces the rest by about 50%.</li>
                
                <li><strong>(15 months) February 2024 -  May 2025:</strong> I had an epiphany : gluten. </li>
                <li class="subtitle">It was hard to find, because there were traces in mayonnaise, oats, etc. It fixes almost everything (with the pinched nerve), until ~May 2025</li>
                
                <li><strong>&emsp;[June 2024]:</strong> Under the advice of a doctor: GLUTEN CHALLENGE: All symptoms come back.</li>
                <li class="subtitle">I feel very bad, and the doctor doesn't contact me again, the secretary calls me to say that it's negative... after 2 weeks, and several months without taking it before, not asking about my symptoms or anything... Gluten sensitivity confirmed, I continue avoiding gluten.</li>
                
                <li><strong>&emsp;[September 2024]:</strong> First major reaction in a long time</li>
                <li class="subtitle">I got a drop of broth (gluten) in my face/eyes. No need to eat it... It's definitely not celiac disease.</li>
                
                <li><strong>(2 months) May 2025 - Now:</strong> I was virtually symptom-free for over a year, but it's back, gradually... Despite a 100% gluten-free diet</li>
                <li class="subtitle">After two trips away from home, returning home increases symptoms; this is no coincidence. Is it the house? Mold?</li>
